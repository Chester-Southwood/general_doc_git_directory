# What we think about (As Game Designers)

* When you become a developer, you saw before what was behind the curtains, so when playing games you think analytically more on how they work; not just the experience. (How, why does this work, why am I having this feeling of elation by just swinging this paddle around, why am I enjoying or not enjoying about this game specifically)

* Kickstarter showed what industry/indie in general. It's a chaotic mess trying to turn pixie dust/prototypes into actual fun games. When the outside world sees the chaos that comes with development (features being changed or removed from intitial vision), they think you're doing something wrong, but in reality that's the process of design.

* It's an incredible feat that games get done on time, let alone at all each year.When things go wrong, it's "trials-and-tribulations", staying as a team from the start to finish the game.
