# 2. Small Things

- Presentation is 1/3 of the game. It all adds up to the overall experience and enjoyment of the game. Some call this (Juice). A punch with no ("umph"/impact) doesn't give the player the satisfaction of striking the opponent anymore than mindlessly just tapping the button. 
  
  - It's also needed to send the player to a state of mind of enjoying the game instead of focusing on any flaws with a product (the game's many, many small bugs that developers don't want you to see)
* If you can't make it fun; make it funny or Easy - Gavin Dodd
  
  * Turn Spyro's 1 hit generic enemies into chickens. This made it at least funny when you attacked them; more fun to the player even though nothing actually changed in terms of gameplay.
  
  * Get a feature through is required sometimes for the overall experience, so at least make it a good time.

* Idea is no value without execution.
  
  * Don't focus on doing the idea to perfection, it's unachieveable. Do what you can as close as possible, sacrafice is needed and refinements can be positives.
  
  * Ideas can be adapted and execution can change.

* Players often don't know what the actual issue with the game is.
  
  * There are Key Words that developers hear that they interpret to what is actually wrong with the game.
    
    * Shallow: The game is too repetitive.
    
    * Boring: No juice (flavor, effects, cutness)
    
    * IDK What To Do: They misunderstand the problem/objective of the game/level.

* Tutorials should be transparent
  
  * Bad ones tell you explicitly or are implemented badly
  
  * Good ones are like the ones in old SNES games. They had tutorials even though many said they didn't, the best tutorials relied on telling the player through gameplay. Those games were limited on text, so they had to explain the game through means on level design, intuitive gameplay.
    
    * Intuitive that a 4 year old can play it.

* Be a guide to the player, not an opponent.
  
  * Worry about player frustration on the critical game path, not so much on the optional sections (go nuts on tormenting them there). Worry about the player completing the base game, not the trophies, extra ending, 100%...
  
  * Dev has great power, can easily kill players. Destroying players should not be part of thinking when designing the game.
  
  * Easy is not bad, can make the game better
